Project Deliverables
1. Weekly Sprint Submissions (on Blackboard, Pass/Fail)
2. Experimental Procedures & Sprint Demos (in-lab)
3. Final Usability Report
4. Final Prototype
5. Final Presentation

â€¢ This is just the final sprint demo, but should be more
professional and polished than regular weekly demos.
